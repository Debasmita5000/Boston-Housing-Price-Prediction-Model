# Boston-Housing-Price-Prediction-Model
🌟 Project Showcase: Boston Housing Price Prediction Model 🌟

I'm excited to share my recent project, where I developed a Boston Housing Price Prediction Model as part of my coursework at Ivy Professional School. A huge thank you to Rakib Sir for his guidance throughout the project and to my trainer, Farukh Sir, for his invaluable support and insights!

🔍 Objective: To predict median house prices in Boston neighborhoods based on key variables, helping to uncover the impact of factors like room count, crime rates, and property tax on housing prices.

💻 Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

📊 Approach & Key Highlights:
1. Algorithms: Developed models using Multiple Linear Regression (69% accuracy) and Decision Tree (79% accuracy).
2. EDA & Statistical Analysis: Conducted thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations, ANOVA, and Correlation analysis to understand data trends and relationships.
3. Data Preprocessing: Improved data quality and model performance by addressing missing values and outliers in a dataset of 506 houses.

This project not only enhanced my technical skills in data preprocessing and machine learning, but also deepened my understanding of statistical analysis and model evaluation.

Thank you again to Ivy Professional School and my mentors for guiding me through this rewarding experience!
